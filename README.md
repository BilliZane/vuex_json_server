For the project to work, you need to install a json server globally.

To install the json server, run:
npm install -g json server

Then the command will work: npm startup api

100 posts will be loaded from the data/db database.json

And the app will work.

1. npm run serve
2. npm run api
3. refresh page http://localhost:8080/
